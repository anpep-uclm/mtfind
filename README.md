## What's this?
`mtfind(1)` is a cross-platform utility that searches for a given sequence of ASCII characters in a file spawning 
the supplied number of threads.

It is also my own approach for the second assignment for my Operating Systems II course.

## Quick start
```sh
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/anpep/mtfind
# Build rzctl
cd mtfind && make
# Try it out!
./mtfind
```
